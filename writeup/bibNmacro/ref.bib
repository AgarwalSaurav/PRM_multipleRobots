This paper proposes a fast algorithm that can provide completeness guarantees for a general class of problems without any assumptions about the graph{\textquoteright}s topology. Specifically, the approach can address any solvable instance where there are at most n-2 agents in a graph of size n. The algorithm employs two primitives: a "push" operation where agents move towards their goals up to the point that no progress can be made, and a "swap" operation that allows two agents to swap positions without altering the configuration of other agents. Simulated experiments are provided on hard instances of cooperative path-finding, including comparisons against alternative methods. The results are favorable for the proposed algorithm and show that the technique scales to problems that require high levels of coordination, involving hundreds of agents.},

	abstract = {Multi-robot path planning is abstracted as the problem of computing a set of non-colliding paths on a graph for multiple robots. A naive search of the composite search space, although complete, has exponential complexity and becomes computationally prohibitive for problems with just a few robots. This paper proposes an efficient and complete algorithm for solving a general class of multi-robot path planning problems, specifically those where there are at most n-2 robots in a connected graph of n vertices. This paper provides a full proof of completeness. The algorithm employs two primitives: "push", where a robot moves toward its goal until no progress can be made, and "swap", that allows two robots to swap positions without altering the position of any other robot. Additionally, this paper provides a smoothing procedure for improving solution quality. Simulated experiments compare the proposed approach with several other centralized and decoupled planners, and show that the proposed technique improves computation time and solution quality, while scaling to problems with 100s of robots, solving them in under 5 seconds.},

This is achieved by assigning goal states to robots to minimize the maximum cost over all robot trajectories. The computational complexity of this algorithm is shown to be polynomial in the number of robots in contrast to the expected exponential complexity associated with planning in the joint state space. This algorithm can be used to plan trajectories for dozens of robots, each in a potentially high dimensional state space. A series of planar case studies are presented and finally, experimental trials are conducted with a team of six quadrotor robots navigating in a constrained three-dimensional environment.",

abstract="This paper introduces an approach that scales assignment algorithms to large numbers of robots and tasks. It is especially suitable for dynamic task allocations since both task locality and sparsity can be effectively exploited. We observe that an assignment can be computed through coarsening and partitioning operations on the standard utility matrix via a set of mature partitioning techniques and programs. The algorithm mixes centralized and decentralized approaches dynamically at different scales to produce a fast, robust method that is accurate and scalable, and reduces both the global communication and unnecessary repeated computation. An allocation results by operating on each partition: either the steps are repeated recursively to refine the generalized assignment, or each sub-problem may be solved by an existing algorithm. The results suggest that only a minor sacrifice in solution quality is needed for significant gains in efficiency. The algorithm is validated using extensive simulation experiments and the results show advantages over the traditional optimal assignment algorithms.",

abstract={We believe the core of handling the complexity of coordinated multiagent search lies in identifying which subsets of robots can be safely decoupled, and hence planned for in a lower dimensional space. Our work, as well as those of others take that perspective. In our prior work, we introduced an approach called subdimensional expansion for constructing low-dimensional but sufficient search spaces for multirobot path planning, and an implementation for graph search called M*. Subdimensional expansion dynamically increases the dimensionality of the search space in regions featuring significant robot-robot interactions. In this paper, we integrate M* with Meta-Agent Constraint-Based Search (MA-CBS), a planning framework that seeks to couple repeatedly colliding robots allowing for other robots to be planned in low-dimensional search space. M* is also integrated with operator decomposition (OD), an A*-variant performing lazy search of the outneighbors of a given vertex. We show that the combined algorithm demonstrates state of the art performance.},

abstract={Probabilistic planners such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) are powerful path planning algorithms for high dimensional systems, but even these potent techniques suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as can be seen in multirobot systems. In this paper, we apply a technique called subdimensional expansion in order to enhance the performance of probabilistic planners for multirobot path planning.We accomplish this by exploiting the structure inherent to such problems. Subdimensional expansion initially plans in each individual robot's configuration space separately. It then couples those spaces when robots come into close proximity with one another. In this way, we constrain a probabilistic planner to search a low dimensional space, while dynamically generating a higher dimensional space where necessary. We show in simulation that subdimensional expansion enhanced PRMs can solve problems involving 32 robots and 128 total degrees of freedom in less than 10 minutes. We also demonstrate that enhancing RRTs and PRMs with subdimensional expansion can decrease the time required to find a solution by more than an order of magnitude.},

abstract={Multirobot path planning is difficult because the full configuration space of the system grows exponentially with the number of robots. Planning in the joint configuration space of a set of robots is only necessary if they are strongly coupled, which is often not true if the robots are well separated in the workspace. Therefore, we initially plan for each robot separately, and only couple sets of robots after they have been found to interact, thus minimizing the dimensionality of the search space. We present a general strategy called subdimensional expansion, which dynamically generates low dimensional search spaces embedded in the full configuration space. We also present an implementation of subdimensional expansion for robot configuration spaces that can be represented as a graph, called M*, and show that M* is complete and finds minimal cost paths.},

abstract ={
               We consider the problem of multi-robot task-allocation when robots have to deal with uncertain utility estimates. Typically an allocation is performed to maximize expected utility; we consider a means for measuring the robustness of a given optimal allocation when robots have some measure of the uncertainty (e.g. a probability distribution, or moments of such distributions). We introduce the interval Hungarian algorithm, a new algorithm that extends the classic Kuhn—Munkres Hungarian algorithm to compute the maximum interval of deviation, for each entry in the assignment matrix, which will retain the same optimal assignment. The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n
               4); we also introduce a parallel variant with O(n
               3) running time, which is able to exploit the concurrent computing capabilities of distributed multi-robot systems. This provides an efficient measurement of the tolerance of the allocation to the uncertainties and dynamics, for both a specific interval and a set of interrelated intervals. We conduct experiments both in simulation and with physical robots to validate the approach and to gain insight into the effect of location uncertainty on allocations for multi-robot multi-target navigation tasks.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new concept - the "Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle"- for real-time multi-agent navigation. We consider the case in which each agent navigates independently without explicit communication with other agents. Our formulation is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept [3], which was introduced for navigation among (passively) moving obstacles. Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillation- free motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.},

abstract ={Reciprocal collision avoidance has become a popular area of research over recent years. Approaches have been developed for a variety of dynamic systems ranging from single integrators to car-like, differential-drive, and arbitrary, linear equations of motion. In this paper, we present two contributions. First, we provide a unification of these previous approaches under a single, generalized representation using control obstacles. In particular, we show how velocity obstacles, acceleration velocity obstacles, continuous control obstacles, and LQR-obstacles are special instances of our generalized framework. Secondly, we present an extension of control obstacles to general reciprocal collision avoidance for non-linear, non-homogeneous systems where the robots may have different state spaces and different non-linear equations of motion from one another. Previous approaches to reciprocal collision avoidance could not be applied to such systems, as they use a relative formulation of the equations of motion and can, therefore, only apply to homogeneous, linear systems where all robots have the same linear equations of motion. Our approach allows for general mobile robots to independently select new control inputs while avoiding collisions with each other. We implemented our approach in simulation for a variety of mobile robots with non-linear equations of motion: differential-drive, differential-drive with a trailer, car-like, and hovercrafts. We also performed physical experiments with a combination of differential-drive, differential-drive with a trailer, and car-like robots. Our results show that our approach is capable of letting a non-homogeneous group of robots with non-linear equations of motion safely avoid collisions at real-time computation rates.},

abstract={Market-based multirobot coordination approaches have received significant attention and are growing in popularity within the robotics research community. They have been successfully implemented in a variety of domains ranging from mapping and exploration to robot soccer. The research literature on market-based approaches to coordination has now reached a critical mass that warrants a survey and analysis. This paper addresses this need for a survey of the relevant literature by providing an introduction to market-based multirobot coordination, a review and analysis of the state of the art in the field, and a discussion of remaining research challenges},

abstract ={Despite more than a decade of experimental work in multi-robot systems, important theoretical aspects of multi-robot coordination mechanisms have, to date, been largely untreated. To address this issue, we focus on the problem of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA). Most work on MRTA has been ad hoc and empirical, with many coordination architectures having been proposed and validated in a proof-of-concept fashion, but infrequently analyzed. With the goal of bringing objective grounding to this important area of research, we present a formal study of MRTA problems. A domain-independent taxonomy of MRTA problems is given, and it is shown how many such problems can be viewed as instances of other, well-studied, optimization problems. We demonstrate how relevant theory from operations research and combinatorial optimization can be used for analysis and greater understanding of existing approaches to task allocation, and to show how the same theory can be used in the synthesis of new approaches.},

abstract={This paper addresses decentralized motion planning among a homogeneous set of feedback-controlled, decision-making agents. It introduces the continuous control obstacle ( Cn-CO), which describes the set of Cn-continuous control sequences (and thus trajectories) that lead to a collision between interacting agents. By selecting a feasible trajectory from Cn-CO's complement, a collision-free motion is obtained. The approach represents an extension to the reciprocal velocity obstacle (RVO, ORCA) collision-avoidance methods so that trajectory segments verify Cn continuity rather than piecewise linearity. This allows the large class of robots capable of tracking Cn-continuous trajectories to employ it for partial motion planning directly-rather than as a mere tool for collision checking. This paper further establishes that both the original velocity obstacle method and several of its recently developed reciprocal extensions (which treat specific robot physiologies only) correspond to particular instances of Cn-CO. In addition to the described extension in trajectory continuity, Cn-CO thus represents a unification of existing RVO theory. Finally, the presented method is validated in simulation-and a parameter study reveals under which environmental and control conditions Cn-CO with admits significantly improved navigation performance compared with inflated approaches based on ORCA.},

An extensive a posteriori vehicle-specific feasibility check is included in the algorithm. The algorithm is applied to a quadrocopter fleet. Experimental results are shown.},

Our emphasis is on the fast execution of efficient search strategies that minimize the number of UAVs and the search time. We present the first approach for computing fast guaranteed search strategies utilizing additional searchers to speed up the execution time and thereby enabling large scale UAV search. In order to scale to very large environments when using UAVs one would either have to overcome the energy limitations of UAVs or pay the cost of utilizing additional UAVs to speed up the search. Our approach is based on coordinating UAVs on sweep lines, covered by the UAV sensors, that move simultaneously through an environment. We present some simulation results that show a significant reduction in execution time when using multiple UAVs and a demonstration of a real system with three AR.Drone 2.0.},

We improve the graph construction from previous work and for the first time present a method that computes a schedule to minimize the execution time. For this we consider travel times of agents determined by a path planner on the height map. We demonstrate the entire system in a real environment with an area of 700,000m2 in which eight human agents search for two intruders using mobile computing devices (iPads). To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a search system applied to such a large environment.},

Each robot can only detect intruders and communicate with other robots within a limited range. No map of the environment is given, and none is built during the process. Robots are only capable of following walls and other robots that are nearby. The algorithm puts together elementary behaviors giving robots the means to coordinate their movement in order to cover lines between opposite walls with their sensors and discover nearby new walls. A line has leading robots at its endpoints that follow walls and hence move the line of robots forward. Multiple such lines move through the entire assigned area in order to detect all intruders. The movement of multiple lines is coordinated by using a graph representation of the environment that describes possible line movements and their associated costs in terms of robots. This coordination requires only local communication between the leaders of different robot lines when they meet. Finally, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be implemented using elementary wall following and obstacle discovery behaviors.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of task partitioning among members of a team of cooperating agents in response to discovery of new tasks or potential failures of some agents. We assume that information about new targets or agent failures is received by individual team members, and communicated asynchronously with delays to the rest of the team. These delays create potential differences in information across the team of agents. We describe an asynchronous approach to coordinating the team response, where individual agents compute modifications to assignments based on local information. We show that the asynchronous algorithms converge to the same optimal assignments in the presence of arbitrary finite communication delays as a centralized information approach. We extend the asynchronous protocol to the solution of a class of stochastic dynamic resource assignment problems, and show asynchronous convergence of the resulting algorithms. Simulations illustrate the delays in computing an optimal assignment of tasks in response to dynamic events.},

abstract ={This paper presents a distributed, guidance and control algorithm for reconfiguring swarms composed of hundreds to thousands of agents with limited communication and computation capabilities. This algorithm solves both the optimal assignment and collision-free trajectory generation for robotic swarms, in an integrated manner, when given the desired shape of the swarm (without pre-assigned terminal positions). The optimal assignment problem is solved using a distributed auction assignment that can vary the number of target positions in the assignment, and the collision-free trajectories are generated using sequential convex programming. Finally, model predictive control is used to solve the assignment and trajectory generation in real time using a receding horizon. The model predictive control formulation uses current state measurements to resolve for the optimal assignment and trajectory. The implementation of the distributed auction algorithm and sequential convex programming using model predictive control produces the swarm assignment and trajectory optimization (SATO) algorithm that transfers a swarm of robots or vehicles to a desired shape in a distributed fashion. Once the desired shape is uploaded to the swarm, the algorithm determines where each robot goes and how it should get there in a fuel-efficient, collision-free manner. Results of flight experiments using multiple quadcopters show the effectiveness of the proposed SATO algorithm.},

    abstract = { Implementation of certain algorithms on parallel computing architectures may involve partitioning contiguous elements into a fixed number of groups, each to be handled by a single processor. We wish to find an assignment of elements to processors that minimizes the sum of the maximum workloads experienced at each stage. This problem may be viewed as a multiobjective network optimization problem. Polynomially-bounded algorithms are developed for the case of two-stages, whereas the general problem, for an arbitrary number of stages, is shown to be NP-hard. Heuristic procedures are therefore proposed and analyzed for the general problem. Computational experience with one of the exact algorithms, incorporating certain pruning rules, is presented for a variety of test problems. Empirical results also demonstrate that one of the heuristic procedures is especially effective in practice. }

year={2015}, 
pages={3132-3139}, 
abstract={The weapon target assignment (WTA) problem is a fundamental problem arising in defense-related applications of operations research, and the multi-stage weapon target assignment (MWTA) problem is the basis of dynamic weapon target assignment (DWTA) problems which commonly exist in practice. The MWTA problem considered in this paper is formulated into a multi-objective constrained combinatorial optimization problem with two competing objectives. Apart from maximizing damage to hostile targets, this paper follows the principle of minimizing ammunition consumption under the consideration of resource constraints, feasibility constraints and fire transfer constraints. In order to tackle the two challenges, two types of multi-objective optimizers: NSGA-II (domination-based) and MOEA/D (decomposition-based) enhanced with an adaptive mechanism are adopted to achieve efficient problem solving. Then a comparison study between adaptive NSGA-II (ANSGA-II) and adaptive MOEA/D (AMOEA/D) on solving instances of three scales MWTA problems is done, and four performance metrics are used to evaluate each algorithm. Numerical results show that ANSGA-II outperforms AMOEA/D on solving multi-objective MWTA problems discussed in this paper, and the adaptive mechanism definitely enhances performances of both algorithms.},

The model takes into consideration the large variation of absorption coefficient (15{\texttimes}) of photoconductors in the visible spectrum and the nonuniform distribution of photogenerated carriers. With the help of this model, we designed opto-electrowetting devices with optimum thickness of photoconductors. This leads to significant improvement in performance compared with prior reports, including 200{\texttimes} lower optical power, 5{\texttimes} lower voltage, and 20{\texttimes} faster droplet moving speed. This enables the use of commercial projectors to create on-demand ``virtual'' electrodes for large-scale parallel manipulation of droplets. We have achieved simultaneous manipulation of 96-droplet array. Finally, we have demonstrated parallel on chip detection of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 within 45 min using a real-time isothermal polymerase chain reaction assay.},

abstract={Micromanipulation has received increasing attention from robotics researchers due to its wide applications in the manipulation of microobjects like biological cells and Bio-MEMS components. The demand for accurate and precise manipulation of microobjects opens up new challenges in automation of micromanipulation tasks. In this paper, we present a concurrent framework for optical manipulation of multiple groups of microobjects using robotic tweezers. The proposed framework is based on laser-stage coordination control and consists of two concurrent subschemes: 1) local coordination achieved by asynchronous manipulation of multiple groups of microobjects using laser beams and 2) global coordination achieved by manipulation of whole groups using a motorized stage. Unlike existing methods that are limited to the manipulation of a single microobject or a single group of microobjects, the proposed method considers concurrent laser-stage coordination of multiple groups of microobjects, which enhances the capability and flexibility in micromanipulation tasks. In addition, we introduce a unified social interaction function to achieve various cellular behaviors. A mathematical formulation is provided and stability analysis is presented. Using the proposed method, we are able to manipulate multiple groups of microobjects to construct time-varying microformations. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

abstract={Various automatic manipulation techniques have been developed for manipulating micro-objects using optical tweezers. Because of the small trapping force of optical traps and increase in kinetic energy during manipulation, a trapped object may not remain trappable, especially in the presence of random Brownian perturbation. However, there is no theoretical analysis so far to help understand the effects of dynamic motion and Brownian forces on the trappability problem of optical tweezers. This paper investigates the optical manipulation of micro-objects under random perturbations. Here, we provide for the first time a theoretical and experimental analysis of the dynamic trapping problem from stochastic perspectives. We derive the relationship between trapping probability and maximum manipulation velocity. A controller with appropriate velocity bound is then proposed to ensure that the system is bound and stable. The experimental results confirm the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and illustrate the necessity and usefulness of the proposed controller.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal pesticide spray scheduling. Regulations impose strict requirements on scheduling, e.g., individual pesticides are only effective during certain seasons and pesticides cannot be sprayed too close to harvest time. We show how to translate these requirements to a metric temporal logic formula over the space of schedules. We next use the theory of optimal mode scheduling to generate a schedule that minimizes the risk of various infestations over time while guaranteeing the satisfaction of the constraints. We demonstrate this methodology via simulation with scheduling constraints based on recommendations and regulations from agricultural experts. Our case study considers blueberries, a crop whose cultivation currently involves little automation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of dynamically positioning a team of mobile robots for target tracking. We treat the coordination of mobile robots for target tracking as a joint team optimization to minimize uncertainty in target state estimates over a fixed horizon. The optimization is inherently a function of both the positioning of robots in continuous space and the assignment of robots to targets in discrete space. Thus, the robot team must make decisions over discrete and continuous variables. In contrast to methods that decouple target assignments and robot positioning, our approach avoids the strong assumption that a robot's utility for observing a target is independent of other robots’ observations. We formulate the optimization as a mixed integer nonlinear program and apply integer relaxation to develop an approximate solution in decentralized form. We demonstrate our coordinated multirobot tracking algorithm both in simulation and using a pair of mobile robotic sensor platforms to track moving pedestrians. Our results show that coupling target assignment and robot positioning realizes coordinated behaviors that are not possible with decoupled methods.},

Thereby, a function                                                                           {\$}{\$}f:X{\backslash}times Y{\backslash}to{\{}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}R{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}                 is called biconvex, if f(x,y) is convex in y for fixed x∈X, and f(x,y) is convex in x for fixed y∈Y. This paper presents a survey of existing results concerning the theory of biconvex sets and biconvex functions and gives some extensions. In particular, we focus on biconvex minimization problems and survey methods and algorithms for the constrained as well as for the unconstrained case. Furthermore, we state new theoretical results for the maximum of a biconvex function over biconvex sets.",

abstract="Aiming at the development of an exact solution method for registration problems, we present two different Branch {\&} Bound algorithms for a mixed integer programming formulation of the problem. The first B{\&}B algorithm branches on binary assignment variables and makes use of an optimality condition that is derived from a graph matching formulation. The second, geometric B{\&}B algorithm applies a geometric branching strategy on continuous transformation variables. The two approaches are compared for synthetic test examples as well as for 2-dimensional medical data. The results show that medium sized problem instances can be solved to global optimality in a reasonable amount of time.",

Let t=min(k,l), where k is the number of distinct weights of elements and l the maximum number of elements in any feasible solution. We propose an approach which solves the lex-bottleneck optimization problem by solving bottleneck and zero–one sum optimizations for at most t iterations and reducing the problem size in each iteration. We also propose another approach which is similar to the above approach but solves only zero–one sum optimizations for at most k iterations. For a graph with n nodes and m arcs, the first approach solves the lex-bottleneck path problem in O(nm) time, and the second approach solves the lex-bottleneck assignment problem in O(m2) time. For lex-bottleneck general matching problem, a time bound of O(min(m,n log n)n(m+n log n)) is given. "

abstract={* Recent years have seen significant technical progress on robot planning, enabling robots to compute actions and motions to accomplish challenging tasks involving driving, flying, walking, or manipulating objects. However, robots that have been commercially deployed in the real world typically have no or minimal planning capability. These robots are often manually programmed, teleoperated, or programmed to follow simple rules. Although these robots are highly successful in their respective niches, a lack of planning capabilities limits the range of tasks for which currently deployed robots can be used. In this article, we highlight key conclusions from a workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation in October 2013 that summarize opportunities and key challenges in robot planning and include challenge problems identified in the workshop that can help guide future research toward making robot planning more deployable in the real world.},

  abstract={
     Teams of mobile robots often need to divide up subtasks efficiently.  In 
spatial domains, a key criterion for doing so may depend on distances  between 
robots and the subtasks' locations.  This paper considers a specific such 
criterion, namely how to assign interchangeable robots, represented as point 
masses, to a set of target goal locations within an open two dimensional space 
such that the makespan (time for all robots to reach their target locations) is
minimized while also preventing collisions among robots.  We present scaleable 
(computable in polynomial time) role assignment algorithms that we classify as 
being SCRAM (Scalable Collision-avoiding Role Assignment with Minimal-makespan).
SCRAM role assignment algorithms use a graph theoretic approach to map agents 
to target goal locations such that our objectives for both minimizing the 
makespan and avoiding agent collisions are met.  A system using SCRAM role 
assignment was originally designed to allow for decentralized coordination 
among physically realistic simulated humanoid soccer playing robots in the 
partially observable, non-deterministic, noisy, dynamic, and limited 
communication setting of the RoboCup 3D simulation league.  In its current form,
SCRAM role assignment generalizes well to many realistic and real-world 
multiagent systems, and scales to thousands of agents.

ABSTRACT = {The significance of thermal heterogeneities in small surface water bodies as drivers of mixing and for habitat provision is increasingly recognized, yet obtaining three-dimensionally-resolved observations of the thermal structure of lakes and rivers remains challenging. Remote observations of water temperature from aerial platforms are attractive: such platforms do not require shoreline access; they can be quickly and easily deployed and redeployed to facilitate repeated sampling and can rapidly move between target locations, allowing multiple measurements to be made during a single flight. However, they are also subject to well-known limitations, including payload, operability and a tradeoff between the extent and density over which measurements can be made within restricted flight times. This paper introduces a novel aerial thermal sensing platform that lowers a temperature sensor into the water to record temperature measurements throughout a shallow water column and presents results from initial field experiments comparing \emph{in situ} temperature observations to those made from the UAS platform. These experiments show that with minor improvements, UASs have the potential to enable high-resolution 3D thermal mapping of a \(\sim\)1-ha lake in 2–3 flights (\textit{circa} 2 h), sufficient to resolve diurnal variations. This paper identifies operational constraints and key areas for further development, including the need for the integration of a faster temperature sensor with the aerial vehicle and better control of the sensor depth, especially when near the water surface.},

abstract={In many multi-robot applications such as target search, environmental monitoring and reconnaissance, the multi-robot system operates semi-autonomously, but under the supervision of a remote human who monitors task progress. In these applications, each robot collects a large amount of task-specific data that must be sent to the human periodically to keep the human aware of task progress. It is often the case that the human-robot communication links are extremely bandwidth constrained and/or have significantly higher latency than inter-robot communication links, so it is impossible for all robots to send their task-specific data together. Thus, only a subset of robots, which we call the knowledge leaders, can send their data at a time. In this paper, we study the knowledge leader selection problem, where the goal is to select a subset of robots with a given cardinality that transmits the most informative task-specific data for the human. We prove that the knowledge leader selection is a submodular function maximization problem under explicit conditions and present a novel distributed submodular optimization algorithm that has the same approximation guarantees as the centralized greedy algorithm. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using numerical simulations.},

abstract = "Attaching a cost function to integers appearing in partitions of an integer n gives rise to a natural least-cost or greatest-profit problem. We present several modifications of the standard O(n2) dynamic programming algorithm for the least-cost problem. One modification results in an average complexity of order O(n3/2 by restriction of possible substitutions; a second in an efficient print algorithm for display of the resultant partition. A third, a prepass eliminating some equations from consideration, guarantees O(n) or O(n log n) efficiency in a number of important special cases; in particular, we can guarantee such efficiency whenever the unit cost function is even approximately monotonically increasing or decreasing. We also give a related algorithm for the problem of partitioning an integer by integers no larger than some upper bound p, of complexity polynomial in p. Finally, we show that no modification of the dynamic programming algorithm (using only pair comparison and information from the permutation of integers induced by sorting the unit costs) is worst-case better than ω(n2)."

  abstract = { Using aerial robots in area coverage applications is an emerging topic. These applications need a coverage path planning algorithm and a coordinated patrolling plan. This paper proposes a distributed approach to coordinate a team of heterogeneous UAVs cooperating efficiently in patrolling missions around irregular areas, with low communication ranges and memory storage requirements. Hence it can be used with small-scale UAVs with limited and different capabilities. The presented system uses a modular architecture and solves the problem by dividing the area between all the robots according to their capabilities. Each aerial robot performs a decomposition based algorithm to create covering paths and a ‘one-to-one’ coordination strategy to decide the path segment to patrol. The system is decentralized and fault-tolerant. It ensures a finite time to share information between all the robots and guarantees convergence to the desired steady state, based on the maximal minimum frequency criteria. A set of simulations with a team of quad-rotors is used to validate the approach. }

The basic approach is to approximate the features of interest with a set of non planar coverage surfaces and to design a motion plan that guarantees the coverage surface is swept completely with a conical-field-of-view sensor. We establish a lower bound on time for a UAV to achieve complete coverage and derive the analytical coverage plan whose duration is a constant times this lower bound.

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a solution for the problem of minimum time coverage of ground areas using a group of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) equipped with image sensors. The solution is divided into two parts: (i) the task modeling as a graph whose vertices are geographic coordinates determined in such a way that a single UAV would cover the area in minimum time; and (ii) the solution of a mixed integer linear programming problem, formulated according to the graph variables defined in the first part, to route the team of UAVs over the area. The main contribution of the proposed methodology, when compared with the traditional vehicle routing problem’s (VRP) solutions, is the fact that our method solves some practical problems only encountered during the execution of the task with actual UAVs. In this line, one of the main contributions of the paper is that the number of UAVs used to cover the area is automatically selected by solving the optimization problem. The number of UAVs is influenced by the vehicles’ maximum flight time and by the setup time, which is the time needed to prepare and launch a UAV. To illustrate the methodology, the paper presents experimental results obtained with two hand-launched, fixed-wing UAVs.},

abstract={This paper addresses the task scheduling and path planning problem for a team of cooperating vehicles performing autonomous deliveries in urban environments. The cooperating team comprises two vehicles with complementary capabilities, a truck restricted to travel along a street network, and a quadrotor micro-aerial vehicle of capacity one that can be deployed from the truck to perform deliveries. The problem is formulated as an optimal path planning problem on a graph and the goal is to find the shortest cooperative route enabling the quadrotor to deliver items at all requested locations. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. A solution is then proposed using a novel reduction to the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem, for which well-established heuristic solvers exist. The heterogeneous delivery problem contains as a special case the problem of scheduling deliveries from multiple static warehouses. We propose two additional algorithms, based on enumeration and a reduction to the traveling salesman problem, for this special case. Simulation results compare the performance of the presented algorithms and demonstrate examples of delivery route computations over real urban street maps.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed great advancements in the science and technology of autonomy, robotics, and networking. This paper surveys recent concepts and algorithms for dynamic vehicle routing (DVR), that is, for the automatic planning of optimal multivehicle routes to perform tasks that are generated over time by an exogenous process. We consider a rich variety of scenarios relevant for robotic applications. We begin by reviewing the basic DVR problem: demands for service arrive at random locations at random times and a vehicle travels to provide on-site service while minimizing the expected wait time of the demands. Next, we treat different multivehicle scenarios based on different models for demands (e.g., demands with different priority levels and impatient demands), vehicles (e.g., motion constraints, communication, and sensing capabilities), and tasks. The performance criterion used in these scenarios is either the expected wait time of the demands or the fraction of demands serviced successfully. In each specific DVR scenario, we adopt a rigorous technical approach that relies upon methods from queueing theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic geometry. First, we establish fundamental limits on the achievable performance, including limits on stability and quality of service. Second, we design algorithms, and provide provable guarantees on their performance with respect to the fundamental limits.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being increasingly used for surveillance missions in civil and military applications. These vehicles can be heterogeneous in the sense that they can differ either in their motion constraints or sensing/attack capabilities. Given a surveillance mission that require a group of heterogeneous UAVs to visit a set of targets, this paper addresses a resource allocation problem of finding the optimal sequence of targets for each vehicle such that 1) each target is visited at least once by some vehicle, and 2) the total cost travelled by all the vehicles is minimized. This problem can be posed as a Heterogeneous, Multiple Depot, Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (HMDMTSP). This paper presents a transformation of a Heterogeneous, Multiple Depot, Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (HMDMTSP) into a single, Asymmetric, Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP). As a result, algorithms available for the single salesman problem can be used to solve the HMDMTSP. To show the effectiveness of the transformation, the well known Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun heuristic was applied to the transformed ATSP. Computational results show that good quality solutions can be obtained for the HMDMTSP relatively fast.},

abstract={This paper proposes a resource-oriented, decentralized auction algorithm (RODAA) for multirobot task allocation considering multiple resources of the robots and limited robot communication range. The resources that this paper focuses on are the expendable supplies that a robot consumes and recharges while performing tasks, such as energy. In the proposed algorithm, each robot generates its cost for the task in a probabilistic manner considering multiple paths that visit none or different combinations of refill stations for performing the task based on the robot's residual resources. For robust and time-efficient task allocation with limited robot communication range in a dynamic network, a multihop-based auction algorithm is proposed. This paper also introduces a solar panel cleaning mission as a new application for multirobot systems and the proposed algorithm is implemented in the simulation of the mission. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of completing the panel cleaning mission faster than other auction-based task allocation algorithms and has lower overall resource consumption.},

abstract={This work is inspired by the problem of planning sequences of operations, as welding, in car manufacturing stations where multiple industrial robots cooperate. The goal is to minimize the station cycle time, i.e., the time it takes for the last robot to finish its cycle. This is done by dispatching the tasks among the robots, and by routing and scheduling the robots in a collision-free way, such that they perform all predefined tasks. We propose an iterative and decoupled approach in order to cope with the high complexity of the problem. First, collisions among robots are neglected, leading to a min-max Multiple Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (MGTSP). Then, when the sets of robot loads have been obtained and fixed, we sequence and schedule their tasks, with the aim to avoid conflicts. The first problem (min-max MGTSP) is solved by an exact branch and bound (B&B) method, where different lower bounds are presented by combining the solutions of a min-max set partitioning problem and of a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP). The second problem is approached by assuming that robots move synchronously: a novel transformation of this synchronous problem into a GTSP is presented. Eventually, in order to provide complete robot solutions, we include path planning functionalities, allowing the robots to avoid collisions with the static environment and among themselves. These steps are iterated until a satisfying solution is obtained. Experimental results are shown for both problems and for their combination. We even show the results of the iterative method, applied to an industrial test case adapted from a stud welding station in a car manufacturing line. This paper is motivated by the problem of planning robot operations in welding applications in the automotive industry. Here, a number of welding tasks have been introduced along the car body: the goal is to let the robots perform such tasks while minimizing the cycle time (or makespan). The main difficulti- s, from the manufacturing engineer perspective, lie in assigning the tasks to the robots, deciding the order and the timing of the operations, avoiding collisions between the robots and the environment, and among the robots themselves. We present in this work an iterative approach, consisting of two steps: first, sequences for the robot operations are computed in order to minimize the cycle time, while neglecting collisions among robots; then, given the assignment of tasks to robots, the operations are reordered and scheduled while avoiding conflicts among robots. Robot motions are also automatically computed to avoid collisions with the static environment. We show an optimal algorithm, for the first part, based on implicit enumeration (B&B) and introduce a novel suboptimal algorithm, for the second part, to synchronize the robots. These algorithms are iterated while fetching information about the problem that are hard to compute, thus following a lazy approach. Tests on problems adapted from the literature and from the automotive industry, show clear improvements over more sequential approaches and good running times. The algorithms are especially suited for cases with up to 40 tasks and 4 robots, as for typical geometry stations. In future works, we will further investigate efficient heuristic optimization approaches in order to handle larger problems, consisting of more than 100 tasks, as for typical assembly stations.},

abstract={We propose an approach to synthesize control protocols for autonomous systems that account for uncertainties and imperfections in interactions with human operators. As an illustrative example, we consider a scenario involving road network surveillance by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is controlled remotely by a human operator but also has a certain degree of autonomy. Depending on the type (i.e., probabilistic and/or nondeterministic) of knowledge about the uncertainties and imperfections in the human-automation interactions, we use abstractions based on Markov decision processes and augment these models to stochastic two-player games. Our approach enables the synthesis of operator-dependent optimal mission plans for the UAV, highlighting the effects of operator characteristics (e.g., workload, proficiency, and fatigue) on UAV mission performance. It can also provide informative feedback (e.g., Pareto curves showing the tradeoffs between multiple mission objectives), potentially assisting the operator in decision-making. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a detailed UAV mission planning case study.},

abstract={Sampling-based algorithms for path planning, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), have achieved great success, thanks to their ability to efficiently solve complex high-dimensional problems. However, standard versions of these algorithms cannot guarantee optimality or even high-quality for the produced paths. In recent years, variants of these methods, such as T-RRT, have been proposed to deal with cost spaces: by taking configuration-cost functions into account during the exploration process, they can produce high-quality (i.e., low-cost) paths. Other novel variants, such as RRT*, can deal with optimal path planning: they ensure convergence toward the optimal path, with respect to a given path-quality criterion. In this paper, we propose to solve a complex problem encompassing this two paradigms: optimal path planning in a cost space. For that, we develop two efficient sampling-based approaches that combine the underlying principles of RRT* and T-RRT. These algorithms, called T-RRT* and AT-RRT, offer the same asymptotic optimality guarantees as RRT*. Results presented on several classes of problems show that they converge faster than RRT* toward the optimal path, especially when the topology of the search space is complex and/or when its dimensionality is high.},

abstract={This paper is concerned with online coverage of unknown planar environments by a mobile robot of size D operating with a limited energy capacity battery. The battery capacity is represented by the path length L that the robot can travel under a full battery charge. Starting at S, the robot has to cover a planar environment containing unknown obstacles, and return to S upon task completion. During task execution, the robot may return to S at any time to recharge its battery. This paper first describes a battery powered offline coverage methodology, then introduces the battery powered coverage (BPC) algorithm that performs online battery powered coverage using position and local obstacle detection sensors. The performance of the BPC algorithm is measured by its competitiveness, determined by measuring the mobile robot's total online path length, l, relative to the optimal offline solution lopt. This paper establishes that the BPC algorithm has a competitive performance of l ≤ ( L/ D) lopt. This paper additionally establishes a universal lower bound of l ≥ log( L/ 4 D) lopt over all online battery powered coverage algorithms. Execution example illustrates the usefulness of the BPC algorithm.},

abstract={Algorithms for fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) must integrate on-board sensor capabilities and vehicle maneuver constraints to reliably satisfy the objectives of persistent surveillance, path planning, and trajectory management. In many cases, the characteristic dimensions of sensor fields of view are comparable with the turning radius of the UAS platform. Consequently, when persistent, full area, time-critical coverage is required and the number of assets is limited, the complexity of path planning is increased, as the turn radius becomes comparable with or exceeds the sensor footprint. A technique is developed to integrate persistent surveillance mission requirements with sensor resolution and field-of-view to facilitate efficient path planning. Graph search techniques and spline-based methods are combined to develop computationally simple algorithms that converge to feasible paths with G2 continuity. (G2 continuity in this context means the path, which is constructed from a concatenated series of C2 curve segments, and its derivatives are continuous through two derivatives, but the magnitudes of second derivatives may differ at the boundaries, where these curve segments are joined to form the entire path. Curvature is continuous throughout). Two example cases are provided. In the first, the turning radius is small in comparison with the sensor footprint, while in the second, the minimum turn radius is a critical parameter in the determination of a feasible path.},

    abstract = { Using aerial robots in area coverage applications is an emerging topic. These applications need a coverage path planning algorithm and a coordinated patrolling plan. This paper proposes a distributed approach to coordinate a team of heterogeneous UAVs cooperating efficiently in patrolling missions around irregular areas, with low communication ranges and memory storage requirements. Hence it can be used with small-scale UAVs with limited and different capabilities. The presented system uses a modular architecture and solves the problem by dividing the area between all the robots according to their capabilities. Each aerial robot performs a decomposition based algorithm to create covering paths and a ‘one-to-one’ coordination strategy to decide the path segment to patrol. The system is decentralized and fault-tolerant. It ensures a finite time to share information between all the robots and guarantees convergence to the desired steady state, based on the maximal minimum frequency criteria. A set of simulations with a team of quad-rotors is used to validate the approach. }

We extend ant colony optimization (ACO) from its well-known application, the traveling salesman problem (TSP), to that of multi-goal feasible path planning for inspection and surveillance applications. Specifically, the ant colony framework is combined with a sampling-based point-to-point planning algorithm; this is compared with two successful sampling-based multi-goal planning algorithms in an obstacle-filled two-dimensional environment. Total mission time, a function of computational cost and the duration of the planned mission, is used as a basis for comparison. In our application of interest, autonomous underwater inspections, the ACO algorithm is found to be the best-equipped for planning in minimum mission time, offering an interior point in the tradeoff between computational complexity and optimality.},

The area is decomposed using sweeping technique. For path planning inside the cells, a novel method is developed where optimal number of lanes are generated to minimize the number of UAV turns to accomplish the mission in minimum time. Also to allow operator interaction and precedence in coverage, a novel lawnmower/Zamboni planner is designed. Simulation results are presented for multiple UAVs are presented and flight test results for one UAV performing a persistent mission is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {The significance of thermal heterogeneities in small surface water bodies as drivers of mixing and for habitat provision is increasingly recognized, yet obtaining three-dimensionally-resolved observations of the thermal structure of lakes and rivers remains challenging. Remote observations of water temperature from aerial platforms are attractive: such platforms do not require shoreline access; they can be quickly and easily deployed and redeployed to facilitate repeated sampling and can rapidly move between target locations, allowing multiple measurements to be made during a single flight. However, they are also subject to well-known limitations, including payload, operability and a tradeoff between the extent and density over which measurements can be made within restricted flight times. This paper introduces a novel aerial thermal sensing platform that lowers a temperature sensor into the water to record temperature measurements throughout a shallow water column and presents results from initial field experiments comparing \emph{in situ} temperature observations to those made from the UAS platform. These experiments show that with minor improvements, UASs have the potential to enable high-resolution 3D thermal mapping of a \(\sim\)1-ha lake in 2–3 flights (\textit{circa} 2 h), sufficient to resolve diurnal variations. This paper identifies operational constraints and key areas for further development, including the need for the integration of a faster temperature sensor with the aerial vehicle and better control of the sensor depth, especially when near the water surface.},

abstract = "In the capacitated arc routing problem with multiple centers (M-CARP) the objective is to find routes starting from the given depots or centers such that each required arc is served, capacity (and usually additional) constraints are satisfied and total travel cost is minimized. In this paper we consider a heuristic transformation of the M-CARP into a multiple center capacitated minimum spanning tree problem with arc constraints, that we call arc-constrained CMST. An algorithm for determining initial feasible solutions as well as an improvement procedure for this problem are described and the “re-translation” of CMST solutions into the CARP context is explained. It is shown that the objective function value of the obtained CARP solution is easily derived from the respective value of the corresponding heuristic CMST solution. Furthermore, the possibility of including side constraints and the consideration of additional objective functions is discussed. Computations on real-world benchmark problems compare the results of the tabu search and simulated annealing metastrategies embedded in the improvement procedure."
