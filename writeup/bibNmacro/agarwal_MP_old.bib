abstract ={In this paper, we consider the problem of concurrent assignment and planning of trajectories (which we denote Capt) for a team of robots. This problem involves simultaneously addressing two challenges: (1) the combinatorially complex problem of finding a suitable assignment of robots to goal locations, and (2) the generation of collision-free, time parameterized trajectories for every robot. We consider the Capt problem for unlabeled (interchangeable) robots and propose algorithmic solutions to two variations of the Capt problem. The first algorithm, c-Capt, is a provably correct, complete, centralized algorithm which guarantees collision-free optimal solutions to the Capt problem in an obstacle-free environment. To achieve these strong claims, c-Capt exploits the synergy obtained by combining the two subproblems of assignment and trajectory generation to provide computationally tractable solutions for large numbers of robots. We then propose a decentralized solution to the Capt problem through d-Capt, a decentralized algorithm that provides suboptimal results compared to c-Capt . We illustrate the algorithms and resulting performance through simulation and experimentation.},

volume = {10}, 
number = {1}, 
year = {2013}, 
doi = {10.5772/52765}, 
abstract ={Using aerial robots in area coverage applications is an emerging topic. These applications need a coverage path planning algorithm and a coordinated patrolling plan. This paper proposes a distributed approach to coordinate a team of heterogeneous UAVs cooperating efficiently in patrolling missions around irregular areas, with low communication ranges and memory storage requirements. Hence it can be used with small-scale UAVs with limited and different capabilities. The presented system uses a modular architecture and solves the problem by dividing the area between all the robots according to their capabilities. Each aerial robot performs a decomposition based algorithm to create covering paths and a ‘one-to-one’ coordination strategy to decide the path segment to patrol. The system is decentralized and fault-tolerant. It ensures a finite time to share information between all the robots and guarantees convergence to the desired steady state, based on the maximal minimum frequency criteria. A set of simulations with a team of quad-rotors is used to validate the approach.},

year = {2013}, 
doi = {10.1177/0278364913507324}, 
abstract ={Multi-robot coverage and exploration are fundamental problems in robotics. A widely used, efficient and distributable algorithm for achieving coverage of a convex environment with Euclidean metrics is that proposed by Cortes which is based on the discrete-time Lloyd’s algorithm. This algorithm is not directly applicable to general Riemannian manifolds with boundaries that are non-convex and are intrinsically non-Euclidean. In this paper we generalize the control law based on minimization of the coverage functional to such non-Euclidean spaces punctured by obstacles. We also propose a practical discrete implementation based on standard graph search-based algorithms. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm by solving efficient coverage problems on a sphere and a torus with obstacles, and exploration problems in non-convex indoor environments.},
