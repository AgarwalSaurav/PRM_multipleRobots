  abstract={
     Teams of mobile robots often need to divide up subtasks efficiently.  In 
spatial domains, a key criterion for doing so may depend on distances  between 
robots and the subtasks' locations.  This paper considers a specific such 
criterion, namely how to assign interchangeable robots, represented as point 
masses, to a set of target goal locations within an open two dimensional space 
such that the makespan (time for all robots to reach their target locations) is
minimized while also preventing collisions among robots.  We present scaleable 
(computable in polynomial time) role assignment algorithms that we classify as 
being SCRAM (Scalable Collision-avoiding Role Assignment with Minimal-makespan).
SCRAM role assignment algorithms use a graph theoretic approach to map agents 
to target goal locations such that our objectives for both minimizing the 
makespan and avoiding agent collisions are met.  A system using SCRAM role 
assignment was originally designed to allow for decentralized coordination 
among physically realistic simulated humanoid soccer playing robots in the 
partially observable, non-deterministic, noisy, dynamic, and limited 
communication setting of the RoboCup 3D simulation league.  In its current form,
SCRAM role assignment generalizes well to many realistic and real-world 
multiagent systems, and scales to thousands of agents.

abstract ={Despite more than a decade of experimental work in multi-robot systems, important theoretical aspects of multi-robot coordination mechanisms have, to date, been largely untreated. To address this issue, we focus on the problem of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA). Most work on MRTA has been ad hoc and empirical, with many coordination architectures having been proposed and validated in a proof-of-concept fashion, but infrequently analyzed. With the goal of bringing objective grounding to this important area of research, we present a formal study of MRTA problems. A domain-independent taxonomy of MRTA problems is given, and it is shown how many such problems can be viewed as instances of other, well-studied, optimization problems. We demonstrate how relevant theory from operations research and combinatorial optimization can be used for analysis and greater understanding of existing approaches to task allocation, and to show how the same theory can be used in the synthesis of new approaches.},

pages = {1261-1285}, 
year = {2016}, 
abstract ={This paper presents a distributed, guidance and control algorithm for reconfiguring swarms composed of hundreds to thousands of agents with limited communication and computation capabilities. This algorithm solves both the optimal assignment and collision-free trajectory generation for robotic swarms, in an integrated manner, when given the desired shape of the swarm (without pre-assigned terminal positions). The optimal assignment problem is solved using a distributed auction assignment that can vary the number of target positions in the assignment, and the collision-free trajectories are generated using sequential convex programming. Finally, model predictive control is used to solve the assignment and trajectory generation in real time using a receding horizon. The model predictive control formulation uses current state measurements to resolve for the optimal assignment and trajectory. The implementation of the distributed auction algorithm and sequential convex programming using model predictive control produces the swarm assignment and trajectory optimization (SATO) algorithm that transfers a swarm of robots or vehicles to a desired shape in a distributed fashion. Once the desired shape is uploaded to the swarm, the algorithm determines where each robot goes and how it should get there in a fuel-efficient, collision-free manner. Results of flight experiments using multiple quadcopters show the effectiveness of the proposed SATO algorithm.},

abstract={We describe a method for formation-change trajectory planning for large quadrotor teams in obstacle-rich environments. Our method decomposes the planning problem into two stages: a discrete planner operating on a graph representation of the workspace, and a continuous refinement that converts the non-smooth graph plan into a set of Ck-continuous trajectories, locally optimizing an integral-squared-derivative cost. We account for the downwash effect, allowing safe flight in dense formations. We demonstrate the computational efficiency in simulation with up to 200 robots and the physical plausibility with an experiment with 32 nano-quadrotors. Our approach can compute safe and smooth trajectories for hundreds of quadrotors in dense environments with obstacles in a few minutes.},

title={Probabilistic roadmaps for path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces},
year={1996},
volume={12},
number={4},
pages={566-580},
abstract={A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (≈150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds)},
